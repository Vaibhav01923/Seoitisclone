// Shared plan data — lives outside app/_components/PricingCards.tsx (a "use
// client" module) so server components (e.g. app/page.tsx's JSON-LD) can
// import the plain array directly. Importing plain data from a "use client"
// file doesn't work: Next.js wraps every export of a client module in a
// client reference, even non-component data, so a server component sees a
// proxy rather than the real array.
