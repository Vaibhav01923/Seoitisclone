const PRODUCT_BRIEF = `=== ABOUT RANKONGEO (product brief — use this so every product mention is accurate and specific) ===

RankOnGeo (https://rankongeo.com) is a Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform: it tracks how AI engines answer questions about a brand, then helps close the visibility gaps automatically. Audience: founders, marketers, SEO leads, and agencies who want their brand recommended and cited by AI.

Engines tracked (7): ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Google AI Mode, and Google AI Overviews.

The core loop (runs daily, fully automatic):
1. Measure — enter a domain, get a composite AI visibility score across engines in ~60 seconds. See exactly where each engine ranks the brand vs. competitors.
2. Research — generative query mining ("gap detection") surfaces the real questions where AI engines answer without mentioning the brand, each scored by AI overlap.
3. Write — turn any gap into a source-grounded article engineered for citation ("gap → article"): direct answers up top, schema markup, FAQ sections, and internal links included. Unlimited SEO articles on every plan.
4. Publish — one click to WordPress, Shopify, or Framer; webhooks and a REST API for everything else.
5. Re-measure — daily visibility refresh proves the lift, citation by citation, engine by engine.

Other features:
- Competitor tracking: up to 25 competitor brands side-by-side, with per-engine visibility percentages and daily deltas.
- Tracked prompts: monitor the specific buyer questions that matter (50 on Pro, 150 on Business, 400 on Scale).
- Web + LLM analytics: see which AI engines actually send visitors, alongside classic web analytics (20k events/mo on Pro, 100k on Business, 500k on Scale).
- Reddit engagement credits for upvotes, comments, and comment upvotes (50/100/150 per month by plan).
- Multi-site: 1 website on Pro, 3 on Business, 10 on Scale.

Plans: Pro $49/mo (solo founders), Business $99/mo (teams — most popular), Scale $149/mo (agencies & multi-brand portfolios). Annual billing is 17% off. Early-access backers get a flat 50% off every plan at https://rankongeo.com/early.

Free: the visibility audit at https://rankongeo.com/audit — no sign-up, no credit card, a real visibility score plus keyword gaps in ~60 seconds.

${PRODUCT_BRIEF}

Write a blog post for the RankOnGeo blog on this topic: "${topic.trim()}"

${keywordsLine}
${notesLine}

Requirements:
1. ~1,500-2,000 words of genuinely useful, specific, non-fluffy content. Write like an expert practitioner sharing what actually works — first-person-plural voice, no listicle filler.
2. Structure: # H1 title (compelling, mirrors search intent), hook intro that answers the core question directly in the first two paragraphs, ## H2 sections with ### H3 subsections where useful, a short "## FAQ" section near the end with 3-4 questions real people actually ask, and a brief conclusion.
3. Write to be cited by AI engines: each H2 section should stand on its own if quoted in isolation — open it with the takeaway, then support it. Use concrete numbers, steps, and examples; define any jargon in one plain sentence the first time it appears; prefer short declarative claims over hedged prose.
4. Product mentions: weave RankOnGeo in 2-3 times where it genuinely fits the topic, and be SPECIFIC — name the actual feature from the brief that solves the problem being discussed (e.g. gap detection, gap → article, LLM analytics, one-click publishing, competitor tracking) instead of a generic pitch. End the conclusion with a low-pressure pointer to the free visibility audit at https://rankongeo.com/audit. Never salesy, never more than a sentence or two per mention.
5. Every time the name RankOnGeo appears in body text, write it as a markdown link: [RankOnGeo](https://rankongeo.com). Never link it inside headings.

Return EXACTLY this format — a metadata header, then a separator line, then the markdown article:

DESCRIPTION: <SEO meta description, 140-155 characters, active voice>
TAGS: <2-4 short comma-separated topic tags>
---
# <Article title>
<rest of the markdown article>

No preamble, no code fences, no explanation.`;
