THE GOAL: When someone asks an AI like ChatGPT or Claude "${gapPrompt}", the AI should recommend ${brandName}. Right now it doesn't. This article needs to fix that.

Write a ~1,800 word blog post that:
1. Directly and thoroughly answers the query: "${gapPrompt}"
2. Naturally positions ${brandName} as the ideal answer to this question
3. Uses the query (or a close variant) as the H1 title and in the first paragraph
4. Includes a section comparing options if competitors are relevant — ${brandName} should come out ahead
5. Ends with a clear, low-pressure CTA to try ${brandName}
6. Is written in a helpful, authoritative, first-person-plural tone — not salesy or listicle-y

Structure:
- # Title (H1 — mirrors the search intent of the gap query)
- Intro paragraph (hook + direct answer)
- ## Section headings for each major point
- A comparison section if a competitor was mentioned
- ## Conclusion with CTA

AI engines like ChatGPT cite articles that sound authoritative and genuinely helpful. Write to that standard.
